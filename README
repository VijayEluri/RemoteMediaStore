This is a test project exploring various technologies including
- Google AppEngine Java
- GWT
- Restful Web Services with Jersey
- OAUTH protocol
- JAXB

The application deployed to Google AppEngie manages information about a personal
media library. Entities managed are artists, songs, media, and more. External
applications - e.g. an MP3 player software - can connect to the application
and obtain data about media or update the library when new songs are played.
